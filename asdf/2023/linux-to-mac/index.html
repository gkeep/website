                <h1 id="my-experience-with-linux">My experience with Linux</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Gennady. I've been using Linux for more than 5 years now. My first experience using Linux was back in 2015 with Ubuntu 14.05. I was trying to install Windows 7 on my laptop, because I hated Windows 8, but couldn’t (I was 13 and couldn’t figure out that I needed to change the BIOS mode from UEFI to Legacy until later). So I tried other OSes.</p>
                <p>Since then, I used Linux a lot more and run it on my main machines since 2019.&nbsp;</p>
                
                <h1 id="what-linux-is-good-at">What Linux is good at</h1>
                <p>Linux, in my humble opinion, truly excels in one thing: <em>there's no "one true way" to do a thing</em>, though as I'll argue later it may also be its downfall, at least on the desktop.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of choice. For a novice Linux user, it may be <em>too much</em> choice. What distro do I use? What desktop environment? What open source program to do thing X? Et cetera.</p>
                <p>For an unprepared user of Windows or macOS, it might just be too much.</p>
                
                <h1 id="gaming-on-linux-has-gotten-a-lot-better">Gaming on Linux has gotten a lot better</h1>
                <p>Linux gaming has been on the rise thanks to Valve Software and their Steam Deck.</p>
                <p>Valve creates tools for their Linux-based handheld console Steam Deck: Proton (compatibility layer for WINE), <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/vkd3d">vkd3d</a>, helping open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk">DXVK</a>. In turn, they help the broad Linux universe, by making their work FOSS. <strong>This is the true power of open source software!</strong> People notice this and are switching to Linux. Just look at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/linux-surpasses-the-mac-among-steam-gamers/">numbers</a>: </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>In July's [2023] survey, Windows was still reported by 96.21 percent of users' systems, so regardless of whether Linux or macOS come in second, it's a decidedly distant second. <strong>Linux managed 1.96 percent</strong>, while macOS accounted for 1.84 percent of machines.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As a Linux gamer, Valve completely changed my computing life. Before tools like Proton, I couldn't imagine fully ditching Windows for Linux. It's not perfect, far from it, but if you would look at the state of Linux gaming two or three years before Proton, you would just see half-baked tools like PlayOnLinux (which honestly looks and feels like it was written fifteen years ago - initial release was in 2007, and the UI, from the looks of it, hasn't been updated. It barely worked for me the last time I tried to use it, which was around 2017), Lutris (which is a lot better than PlayOnLinux and worked <em>most of the times</em>, but far from always), and of course, native Linux games provided by developers on GOG, Steam and itch.io (though with caveats like no GOG Galaxy app, so you <strong>cannot sync your save files to this day</strong>).</p>
                <p>But with Valve's help, Linux gaming evolved substantially: according to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> you can now play 60% of your Steam library. And that doesn't count games outside of Steam, on platforms like Epic Games Store, GOG and others. You can even play <em>some</em> games with anticheat (like Apex Legends, DayZ and more) since Steam Deck's launch back in February 2022.</p>
                <p>When Proton launched back in 2018, it changed lives for a lot of Linux gamers. You could now possibly play any Steam game on Linux, with performance hits, of course, but you <em>could</em>! Over the following years, Valve much improved their Proton compatibility layer. </p>
                <p>I think I fully switched to Linux on my desktop PC late 2019 or early 2020, before that I already ran Linux on my laptops for years, since I did not need to run games on them. As a Software Developer, it was just easier to build, run and debug my programs on Linux, rather than on Windows. Plus, I could tinker with my PC much more than I ever could on Windows.</p>
                
                <h1 id="but">But...</h1>
                <p>But there was always one big elephant in the room (or a <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/Heckert_GNU_white.svg" alt="GNU Bull" width="70px"/>, if you will). <strong>Linux's fragmentation</strong>. From the distro of your choosing (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch Linux, Manjaro, POP!_OS, you get the idea), to desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, obscure setups with plain window managers like i3wm, sway, dwm, Openbox, etc) and even window management protocols (X11 or Wayland). From a user's point of view this is very confusing (why would I use Arch over Ubuntu or Wayland over X11 or GNOME over KDE?), but from a developer's point of view it's just scary. </p>
                <p><em>How would I ever manage to test my app/game on all the infinite amount of possible setups?</em> </p>
                <p>Well on (server) software development side, this was solved by using tools like Docker, which package your application in a container and ship it in a mini virtual environment, agnostic of the host system. Desktop applications are moving to a similar-in-concept style of packaging with Snap and Flatpak. Snap (personally) is not good, bad performance, parts of it are closed source (which stands against the philosophy of FOSS and Linux). Flatpak is better (fully open source, apps are easy to package and maintain), but still not perfect. And, of course, some users are just plain refusing to adopt new standards (some even reject using systemd, which has been the default system and service manager on most Linux distros for more than 10 years) and stick to the good ol' "download this app from my distro's packaging solution or compile it from source" approach.</p>
                
                <h2 id="nvidia">NVIDIA</h2>
                <p>And on top of all that, there's <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. Oh, NVIDIA, I can't describe how much I hate <del>you</del> your approach to Linux. There's a reason Linus Torvalds has publicly said "<a href="https://youtu.be/iYWzMvlj2RQ?t=30">NVIDIA, fuck you</a>".</p>
                <p>For the whole time of Linux's existence, NVIDIA has just been a big pain in the ass. 9 out of 10 borked Ubuntu installations I encountered were because of NVIDIA drivers. This game that totally works on other people's PCs doesn't work on yours for some reason? Probably NVIDIA drivers. Wayland doesn't work? Well, you probably use an NVIDIA GPU, and NVIDIA just has no plans on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/NVIDIA">making it easier for developers</a> to make Wayland work on their GPUs.</p>
                <p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-NVK-Vulkan-Merged">been better with Linux recently</a>, but the long history of hostile approach to Linux makes it hard to believe that major changes will come from this.</p>
                
                <h1 id="so-why-exactly-am-i-switching-to-mac">So why, exactly, am I switching to Mac</h1>
                <p>TL;DR: it's a death by a thousand paper cuts. </p>
                <p>I'm tired of always fixing my distro, poking around in system files to make something work or debugging some app that crashes or doesn't work as it's supposed to. Besides always checking if this game will run on my Linux machine and/or fixing this particular game, so it can run or <em>run properly</em>.</p>
                <p><em>I don't have time anymore for this 'hobby' of maintaining a Linux desktop.</em></p>
                <p>I'm not saying I'm never going to use desktop Linux ever again, I'm just saying that I'm going to use my PC with Linux for gaming (with games I am 100% sure will run without much fuss) and will use it as more of a home server, rather than a desktop machine.</p>
                
                <h1 id="what-am-i-using-now">What am I using now</h1>
                <p>So, being very frustrated with desktop Linux lately, I pulled the plug on an M2 MacBook Air. </p>
                <p>This little machine is probably faster than my desktop (don't count gaming because Apple hates gaming or the gaming industry hates Apple). I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I just love it. Everything <strong>just works™</strong>. The laptop is fast, silent (there's no fan!) and tightly integrates with apps I love, with the power of <del>Apple Silicon</del> ARM. I can use apps on the desktop like Timery, Fantastical and Overcast which I adore on my iPhone. Not to mention the tight integration and sync between my Apple devices (iPhone, AirPods and now MacBook) with Focus, iCloud suite and everything else.</p>
                <p>I may have turned to the dark side, but it's nice here.</p>
